Tool made on Abyss1ne's behalf.
Takes bnd archives with flvers in them from one map and outputs them ready for another map by changing the map ids within the flvers and bnds.
Usage:
FlverMapMigrator.exe "Your Map Path here" m69_02_01_00

ex. FlverMapMigrator.exe "B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\map\m35_00_00_00" m69_02_01_00

Output path for the above would be B:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\DARK SOULS III\Game\map\m69_02_01_00_out

bnd files without flver models would be untouched
